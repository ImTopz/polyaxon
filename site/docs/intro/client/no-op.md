## Overview

The no-op mode allows users to turn off all API calls and silently pass through all function calls. this behavior is generally useful if a user needs to debug or test
a script without the need to connect to a Polyaxon Cluster.

## Disabling Polyaxon clients without changing code

Since using the Polyaxon client and the tracking API requires code change, e.g.

```python
# Polyaxon experiment
experiment = Run()
# training code ...
# Metrics reporting
experiment.log_metrics(step=1000, loss=0.01, accuracy=0.97)
```

Users might need to run the same code outside of a Polyaxon context,
which will break since Polyaxon related operations perform API calls.

Users won't need to perform any change to their code,
they just need to set an environment variable `POLYAXON_NO_OP` to true/1, and the Polyaxon related code will be ignored.
